The Dia landing page was created for a creative agency Air. The landing page contains information about the company, its expertise, areas of activity, reviews about the company and contact information.

The landing page was created according to [Figma design]([https://www.figma.com/file/cRBCqE06cDrY3s4jX7h3iY/%D0%9D%D0%90%D0%9C%D0%A3-(Edit)?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/7qwsWggv9BAxMi2VPhBuPr/Air-(formerly-Dia))?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=eXzDVpfvVNaqNooB-0).

When creating the landing page, i used HTML, SCSS, BEM.
